Description: Perceptron
        ==========
        
        |PyPI version| |Build Status|
        
        Perceptron implements a *multilayer perceptron* network written in Python.
        This type of network consists of multiple layers of neurons, the first
        of which takes the input. The last layer gives the ouput. There can be
        multiple middle layers but in this case, it just uses a single one.
        
            For further information about multilayer perceptron networks, please
            read `this <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron>`__
            entry on the Wikipedia.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        -  `python <https://www.python.org/>`__ >= 2.7
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can install the package via ``easy_install`` or ``pip``:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            easy_install perceptron
            pip install perceptron
        
        Feeding Forward
        ---------------
        
        The neural network uses the *hyperbolic tangent (tanh)* function.

           :alt: Hyperbolic tangent
        
           Hyperbolic tangent
        
        The x-axis is the total input to the node. As the input aproaches to 0,
        the output starts to climb quickly. With an input of 2, the output is
        almos at 1 and doesn't get much higher. This is a type of *sigmoid*
        functions to calculate the output of the neurons.
        
            Note: Before runing the ``feedforward`` algorithm, the network will
            have to query the nodes and connections, and build, in memory, the 
            position of the network that is relevant to a specific input.
        
        Training with Backpropagation
        -----------------------------
        
        The backpropagation algorithm then performs the following steps.
        
        For each node in the output layer:
        
        1. Calculate the difference between the node's current output and what it should be.
        2. Use the ``dtanh`` function to determine how much the node's total input has to change.
        3. Change the strenght of every inconming input in proportion to the input's current strength and the learning rate.
        
        For each node in the hidden layer:
        
        1. Change the output of the node by the sum of the strength of each output value multiplied by how much its targets has to change.
        2. Use the ``dtanh`` function to determine how much the node's total input has to change.
        3. Change the strenght of every inconming input in proportion to the input's current strength and the learning rate.
        
        The implementation of this algorithm actually calculates all the errors
        in advance and then adjusts the weigths, because all the calculations
        rely on knowing the current weights rather than the updated weights.
        
            Note: Before runing ``backpropagation`` method, it's necessary to
            run ``feedforward`` so that the current output of every node will be
            stored in the instance variables.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Import the module at the beginning of your file:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from perceptron import mlp
        
        Init the ``neural network``:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            n = mlp.Net()
        
        Example
        -------
        
        In this example the neurons in the first layer respont to the ids that
        are used as input. If a id is present, then the neurons that are strongly
        connected to that word become active. The second layer is fed by the
        first layer, so it responds to combinations of ids. Finally, the neurons
        feed their result to the outputs, and particular combinations may be
        strongly or weakly associated with the possible results. In the end,
        the final decision is whichever output is strongest classifying an id.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from perceptron import mlp
        
            def main():
              n = mlp.Net()
        
              for i in range(30):
                n.train([101,103],[201,202,203],201)
                n.train([102,103],[201,202,203],202)
                n.train([101],[201,202,203],203)
        
              print n.eval([101,103,],[201,202,203])
              print n.eval([102,103],[201,202,203])
              print n.eval([103],[201,202,203])
        
            if  __name__=='__main__': main()
        
        That will give the following output.
        
        .. code::
